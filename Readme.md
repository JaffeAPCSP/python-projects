## APCSP Python Algorithm Projects

This project contains a collection of Python projects taken from https://emkc.org/challenges/

Each file includes a description of the task in the comments along with several sample
inputs and outputs you can use to test your code.

Each file also indicates where you should place your code to solve the problem.  

Use `print()` statements to print your results.

* If you want each `print()` statement to go to the next line use `print("Hello world!")`.

* If you want to print and stay on the same line use `print("Hello world!", end="")`.

Check your code by:

* Open a terminal window
* Use `cd` to go into the correct folder
* Once in the right folder enter `iPython`
* Run your code with `run <file-name> <sample-input1> <sample-input2> ...` and compare your output with the instructions.

### If you want to do this correctly you should write an algorithm or flowchart first!!

Useful built-in Python functions

* `int(string)`:  Converts a string number to an integer.  `int("42")` returns 42

* `str(number)`: Converts a number to a string.  `str(42)` returns "42"
